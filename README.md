üõ†Ô∏è Technical Workflow
Data Wrangling & Cleaning: Handled missing data, dropped invalid records, and ensured proper data type conversion for numerical and date fields.  
Feature Engineering: Calculated the Sales column, and derived temporal (Month, Hour) and geographic (City) features using string splitting for analytical grouping.
Core Analysis: Used Pandas groupby() functions to aggregate data and extract all key metrics across time, location, and product categories
